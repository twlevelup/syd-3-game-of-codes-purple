### Installing Homebrew for Mac OS X

1. The installation of [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) requires ruby to be installed on your Mac. You can check that ruby is installed by running `which ruby` from a terminal. If a path is present then carry on with step 3, otherwise continue with step 2.
2. To install Ruby, simply install it with [RVM](http://rvm.io/). The following command can be run:
  * `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby` - This will install RVM _AND_ the latest version of Ruby.
3. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) by running:

  * `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"`


<a name="go"/>
### Making it go:

Now after cd'ing into the project directory, you should be able to run your tests. Running

     busted

should output something like:

    ●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●
    21 successes / 0 failures / 0 pending : 0.004726 seconds.

You should also be able to run:

and see a happy little nyancat.
